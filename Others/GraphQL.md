### GraphQL

- Specification around HTTP for how you get and receive responses.
- Normally, you use REST POST, GET, DELETE, PUT, etc...
- GraphQL gives you a single endpoint, and the data you get back is based on the query you send to the endpoint.
- PRO: Get as much or as little info that you need = Query specific and nested information just by calling server once!
- Can build on top of HTTP.
- Can use node.js/express.
### Apollo
- There is an apollo client which you install to react, other frontend and an apollo server which you install to node.js, other backend.
