アジャイルとウォーターフォール開発の違い​
- Graph cost and schedule different arrow
- It's probably not describing the main thing of Agile but just confusing?

アジャイル開発において気を付けたい点​
- Slalom Discovery Phase is fuwatto (only planning the first few sprints and direction of the project)
- Other companies have documents (keiyaku)
- My opinion: It doesn't contradict and it's ok to keep as is

スクラムの定義​
- Add info to slide or remove it completely?
- Show everyone is mostly using Scrum
- https://www.xpand-it.com/blog/top-5-agile-methodologies/
- My opinion: Just keep it as it is

スクラムチームの構成  ​
- In Slalom, PEM uses Solution Owner
- My opinion: No need to mention Solution Owner -> If want add in next steps after Day 3 (this is a good idea)
