## Why Golang?

### Why a new language?

- Python (easy to use but slow), Java (complex type system), C/C++ (complex type system, slow compile time).
- Multi-threaded app is rare, concurrency is patched.

### Golang
- Strong and statically typed, type of variable cannot change over time.
- Has to be compiled during compile time.
- Many features omitted for simplicity.
- One binary, compiled to standalone binary.
