- Application ~ Session is Application Layer because they handle data. Data is broken up in Transport Layer.

### Application Layer
- Application: Application, protocols, and services that interface with the end user.
- Presentation: Data is formatted, converted, encrypted/decrypted, compressed/decompressed and sent or presented to the user (MIME types).
- Session: Open, close, and manage a session between end-user application processes (RPC). 

### Transport
- Facilitate end-to-end communications between multiple application simultaneously (ports). Example. Port 22 (ssh), port 21 (ftp), port 80 (http).
- Reliable and unreliable end-to-end data transport and data stream services (TCP - reliable -> , UDP - unreliable, SCTP).
- Connection oriented, connectionless communications, and data stream
